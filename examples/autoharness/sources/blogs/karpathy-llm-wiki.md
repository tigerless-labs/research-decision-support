# [博客] llm-wiki — Andrej Karpathy

[gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) · 2026-04-03. An "idea file" (5k+★/forks on one md), not a product — meant to be pasted into Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode so the agent co-builds the specifics.

**The thesis (compiler analogy):** raw sources = source code, the wiki = the compiled binary. *"Obsidian is the IDE. The LLM is the programmer. The wiki is the codebase."* Compile knowledge once into structured interlinked markdown and read the compiled output; don't RAG-rederive per query. Explicitly *"avoids the need for embedding-based RAG infrastructure"* at moderate scale.

**Three layers:** `raw/` (immutable sources — re-compilable ground truth) · the **wiki/** (LLM-owned markdown: entity / concept / summary / comparison pages + `index.md` + append-only `log.md`) · the **schema** (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` — turns a generic agent into a disciplined maintainer). **Three operations:** ingest · query · lint.

**Structure = GRAPH, not tree.** Pages are many-to-many `[[wikilinks]]` (Memex / associative trails; Obsidian graph view shows hubs vs orphans). Pages sit in category dirs, but the model is associative, not a folder hierarchy.

**Ingest = synthesize, not append.** A new source: read → discuss takeaways → write a summary page → **update index** → **update relevant entity & concept pages across the wiki** → append to `log.md`. One source *"might touch 10–15 wiki pages"*; it revises summaries, flags contradictions, strengthens cross-links.

**Index & growth — the unsolved part.** `index.md` is *"a catalog of everything in the wiki — each page listed with a link, a one-line summary,"* organized by category (entities/concepts/sources), updated every ingest. **Every page is eligible — there is no top-layer-only rule.** Karpathy does **not** address index-explosion: no dedup/merge rule, no page-count cap, no append-vs-new-page rule. His only growth answers: (a) category organization, (b) `lint` (catch orphans, contradictions, stale claims, gaps), (c) **at larger scale, offload to external search (qmd: on-device BM25/vector + LLM re-rank)** rather than manage the index. Stated sweet spot: *"~100 sources, ~hundreds of pages."*

**Relevance to autoharness.** The source thesis behind the file-based memory wave (OpenHuman, Hermes session-search): *maintain a structured, human-inspectable text store; compile once, don't re-derive* — our spine's structural-first / no-oracle / human-adoption stance, stated upstream. Two sharp contrasts that define our wedge:
- **Graph vs typed DAG:** Karpathy's links are untyped associative `[[ ]]`; ours are **typed** (dependency / conflict / duplicate), which is what lets retrieval return a dependency-complete bounded set and lets the manager reason about conflict/dup structurally.
- **Index-explosion is exactly the gap we fill.** Karpathy has no admission gate and punts growth to lint + external search. Our **gated admission** (dedup check + conflict check + recurrence gate; addition is last-resort) and **maintain-not-grow** are the structural answer he lacks — direct positioning for [synthesis/](../../synthesis/index.md). Note also: [OpenHuman](../github/tinyhumansai-openhuman.md) re-shaped the *graph* into a hierarchical *summary tree* — the ecosystem is already diverging on structure.
